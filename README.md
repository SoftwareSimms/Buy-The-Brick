Using a database eventually for security

Would of set up a database for the future due to the increase in the amount of data

I planned to have features such as deal of the week, goofy mode and a feature on suprise button that would give the user a discount code they could only use for 10:00 mins, a timer would appear and every click they make a small explosion animation and sound would play. I intended to allow an admin, using Oauth authentication, to add and edit bricks and sets currently displayed for sale. There is an attempt at creating the functionality to change orders and mark them as dispatched. However as the deadline closed it become dangerous to create new functionality. It doesn't help that my index.js is not as modulerised as it could potentially be, it is very difficult to look through the code to find what I need to find, espcially in a rush!

I set out to have a clear and intutive UI which i think I have acheieved, the page shows all you need to see without any excess, I wanted it to look as simple as possible, this is due to the fact people buying from this store would most likely be buying in bulk and would despise advertising and quirky fashionable UI features as seen in high end stores.

filters were also not implemented and i fully intended to.
